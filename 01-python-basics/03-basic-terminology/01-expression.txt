- An expression is often composed of values (operands) + operators

- An expression always evaluate (reduce down) to a single value

- For mathematical expression, the order of operations (precedence) is followed
    1. Parenthesis
    2. Multiplication / Division
    3. Addition / Subtraction
    NOTE: To override the order, use parenthesis ( )
